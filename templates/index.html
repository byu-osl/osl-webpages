	<p>We build apps that help local governments connect with

	  resources to purchase expensive proprietary systems. Using

	  to help improve the software, while benefiting from a much
	  more complete and flexible system than they could afford on
	  their own.</p>

	<p>We have a passion for helping families find their
	  ancestors. BYU is uniquely positioned to contribute
	  technology that makes a difference in this area -- we have
	  professors actively conducting research in related areas,
	  such as handwriting recognition, image analysis, machine
	  learning, social networking, usability, and software
	  engineering. We also enjoy a relationship with
	  <a href="http://familysearch.org">FamilySearch</a>, since it
	  is also operated by the LDS Church. Building open source
	  software is our way of collaborating with a worldwide
	  community of developers who share our passion.

	<h3>Mission</h3>
	<p>Our mission is to create software that makes the world a
	better place. We build software that anyone can use or modify
	free of charge, in the spirit of community service that is at
	the heart of BYUâ€™s mission. We are funded entirely via
	donations from people who enjoy our work and want to see what
	we dream up next.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="span4">
	<h3>Mentoring</h3>
	<p>We mentor students through the process of creating software
	that can help them to make a difference. We have a strong
	emphasis on usability and design, because the user comes
	first. We use the latest tools and practices so students can
	acquire cutting-edge skills.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="span4">
	<h3>Get Involved</h3>
	<p>We are seeking partners that are willing to sponsor a
	project, provide guidance on design, or contribute
	code. We have a limited number of paid lab positions available
	to BYU students and are seeking donations to expand the number
	of students we can support.</p>
